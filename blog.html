            Var, Let, and Const - what's the difference?

          <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>
              The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration
              in JavaScript include: Variables declared with var and const are
              scoped to the immediate function body. Variables declared with the
              var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be
              accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
              Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which
              means the variables will have scope to the immediate enclosing
              block.

            What are the differences between regular functions and arrow
            functions?

              There are two major benefits of using Arrow functions. One is that
              it's a shorter syntax and thus requires less code. The main
              benefit is that it removes the several pain points associated with
              the this operator. In JS arguments array in functions is a special
              object that can be used to get all the arguments passed to the
              function. Similar to this, arrow functions do not have their own
              binding to a arguments object, they are bound to arguments of
              enclosing scope.Arrow functions do not have their own this value.
              The value of this inside an arrow function is always inherited
              from the enclosing scope.

              The first difference between map() and forEach() is the returning
              value. The forEach() method returns undefined and map() returns a
              new array with the transformed elements. Even if they do the same
              job, the returning value remains different. The second difference
              between these array methods is the fact that map() is chainable.
              This means that you can attach reduce(), sort(), filter() and so
              on after performing a map() method on an array. That's something
              you can't do with forEach() because, as you might guess, it
              returns undefined. In general, the word "mutate" means change,
              alternate, modify or transform. And in the JavaScript world it has
              the same meaning. A mutable object is an object whose state can be
              modified after it is created. forEach() does not mutate the array
              on which it is called. (However, callback may do so). map() does
              not mutate the array on which it is called (although callback, if
              invoked, may do so).

            Why will we use template string in javascript?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>
              Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript
              released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and
              expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in
              older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that
              are complex and contain dynamic elements. In certain cases,
              nesting a template is the easiest (and perhaps more readable) way
              to have configurable strings. Within a backtick-delimited
              template, it is simple to allow inner backticks by using them
              inside an ${expression} placeholder within the template.
